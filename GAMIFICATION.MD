# GiGoFit — Gamification Design

## MILESTONE IDEAS

### 1. First Ascent
- Trigger: First completed workout with at least one set.
- Why: Rewards completion over performance; strongest day-1 retention lever.

### 2. Form Builder
- Trigger: Log 3 distinct exercises.
- Why: Pushes beginners to learn movement variety early.

### 3. Consistency Spark
- Trigger: 3 sessions within 7 days.
- Why: Habit-forming cadence that is hard enough to matter but realistic.

### 4. Volume Breakthrough
- Trigger: 5,000 lb cumulative volume.
- Why: Concrete non-PR progression target that works for all users.

### 5. Discipline Badge
- Trigger: `Low Energy` session at >=90% of previous volume.
- Why: Reinforces showing up on low-motivation days.

## Stat Engine (Implemented)
- Strength: total volume tiering
- Agility: sessions/week over trailing active weeks
- Endurance: average session duration
- Focus: low-energy consistency count
- Fury: crushing-it session count

## Next Gamification Steps
- Tie stat tiers to avatar/sprite variants
- Add milestone unlock animations and inventory metadata
- Add progression timeline UI in Analytics/Ascent
